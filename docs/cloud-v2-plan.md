# Cloud v2 — FloCafe client plan

Status: **Phase 1 implemented in the client.** This is the FloCafe-side work for the FloAdmin v2 cloud
redesign agreed 2026-08-01. Cross-app contracts live in the private specs repo; this file covers
only what changes inside this repository.

## Phase 1 implementation notes

- New installs enable cloud coordination automatically and register by
  `cloud_pos_hash`; there is no claim, pending, or human approval step.
- Pairing uses the server-issued eight-digit, single-use code. Routine refreshes do not
  disconnect existing RevFlo devices; only an explicit revoke action does.
- RevFlo pairing is now QR-ready: FloCafe shows the short-lived pairing code
  as readable digits and as a QR containing only that code. RevFlo's Pair
  screen should scan and validate the numeric payload, then reuse the existing
  `POST /api/pairing/redeem` request; manual entry remains the fallback when
  camera access is unavailable.
- Support requests are one-way, durable local outbox entries. They retry when
  the POS is online and deduplicate by `client_ticket_id`.
- Printer failures expose a correlation ID and structured error stage so a
  merchant can send useful diagnostics without exposing billing data.
- Registration's `business` payload sends `contact_name`, `email`, `currency`,
  and `address` alongside the existing `name`/`phone`/`country`/`timezone` —
  migration 005 on FloAdmin added columns for these plus `gstin`/`state_code`,
  but FloAdmin does not require GSTIN or state code, so FloCafe deliberately
  does not send them. Those two columns stay unused; `pos.php` already
  `COALESCE`s missing fields, so no FloAdmin-side change is needed.

### Automatic country tax plugins

Taxes remain off until the owner explicitly enables them. The owner selects a
country only in business settings; the tax screen never exposes a plugin
catalog, country-pack selector, download button, or manual activation flow.
When taxes are enabled, FloCafe asks FloAdmin to resolve the current country,
then verifies, downloads, installs, and activates the matching plugin. If no
verified plugin exists, FloCafe leaves taxes off, queues one support ticket per
country, and keeps a visible message explaining that the plugin has been
requested and will be built soon. Changing the business country while taxes
are enabled repeats the same automatic resolution and disables taxes if the
new country is not yet supported.

Nothing here affects offline operation. **Billing must never block on the cloud** — that rule is
unchanged, and every item below is required to degrade quietly when the network is gone.

---

## Why

Two problems, both visible in production today.

**Onboarding dies at a manual step.** A fresh install registers with the cloud, lands in a
pending queue, and polls forever waiting for a human to approve it. Most installs never get past
that point. v2 deletes the step: a POS creates its own store record on first boot and is
immediately usable.

**Failures are unactionable.** A merchant sees `KOT print failed`. That single string covers a
dead printer, a paused OS spooler, a network drop, a malformed payload, and a cloud timeout — and
nothing distinguishes them afterwards. There is no way to tell which stage failed, and no way for
the merchant to ask for help with the evidence attached.

---

## 1. Auto-register on first boot

Replaces the register → pending → poll → claim flow in `main/services/cloud-sync.ts`.

- `register()` returns a `store_id` and `api_key` immediately. There is no pending response shape
  to handle any more.
- **Delete** `pollStatus()`, the `GET /api/pos/status` timer, `pending_store_id`, and the
  `cloud_registration_status = 'pending'` branch.
- Existing installs keep their identity: the install UUID is unique server-side, so a POS that
  already registered is recognised rather than duplicated. No re-onboarding, no user action.
- Registration still must not block startup — keep the existing backoff and the "billing works
  regardless" guarantee.

**Cloud becomes on by default.** `seedInstallDefaults()` currently seeds `cloud_sync_enabled = '0'`;
it becomes `'1'` to match the server. Auto-registering *is* contacting the cloud, so leaving the
flag off would mean the POS and server disagree about the same install.

**Existing installs get flipped on too — but only those that never touched the setting.** The two
cases are distinguishable, and the distinction must be honoured:

| `settings.updated_at` for `cloud_sync_enabled` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| No `T` (e.g. `2026-07-04 09:12:33`) | Written by `seedInstallDefaults()`, never edited — SQLite's `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` default | **Flip to `'1'`** |
| Contains `T` (e.g. `2026-07-04T09:12:33.456Z`) | Written by `upsertSettings()` → `now()` → `toISOString()` — a human changed it | **Leave alone** |

The seed uses `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO settings (key, value)` and omits `updated_at`; every other
write path sets it explicitly from `now()`. That difference is the discriminator — verify it still
holds before relying on it.

Ship as a numbered migration (next after v39), not as a change to `seedInstallDefaults()` alone —
the seed only runs on a fresh database, so existing installs would otherwise never move.

## 2. Pairing code: 8 digits, 24 hours

Touches `main/routes/index.ts` (`/api/mobile/pairing-code`, `/api/mobile/rotate-code`), the cache
helpers in `main/db.ts`, and the Settings → Mobile App screen.

- Code widens 6 → 8 digits; validity extends 10 minutes → 24 hours, so an owner can open Settings
  and read a code that still works.
- The code is still generated by the server and cached locally — unchanged, and deliberately so.
- **The routine 24-hour roll must not send `revoke_devices`.** Only the explicit *"generate a new
  code and disconnect everyone"* action may. Getting this wrong kicks every paired phone daily.
- Multiple phones may stay paired to one store. That is already true and stays true.

## 3. Error taxonomy and correlation ids

Prerequisite for §4 and §5 — do this first.

- A central, versioned error-code taxonomy (e.g. `print.kot.spooler_timeout`) covering printing,
  tax, migrations, backups, cloud sync, and updates.
- A correlation id created before each critical operation and carried through every log line,
  user-facing message, and telemetry event for that operation.
- Replace boolean printer outcomes with typed results that preserve **the failing stage** plus
  safe OS/network detail. `main/printers/thermal.ts` is the first target.
- The user-visible message stays short and plain, with a support code appended.

## 4. Diagnostics opt-in (store-attributed)

> **CURRENT STATE note:** Despite the "opt-in" design intent below, new installs currently seed `diagnostics_consent='true'` in `seedInstallDefaults()` (`main/db.ts`). Owners can disable in Settings. **TARGET STATE** should align implementation with explicit consent requirements.

A second, opt-in telemetry stream that carries the store id, so a maintainer can look at one
store's recent failures instead of fleet aggregates.

- **Separate consent from `anonymous_data_consent`.** Existing installs agreed to *anonymous*
  collection only; reusing that flag to start sending identified data would break that promise.
- Send: store id, severity, error code, correlation id, app version, platform, redacted metadata.
- **Never send** merchant name, email, phone, addresses, customer data, or order contents. The
  server joins contact details from the store record when it needs them.
- Enabled by default so support diagnostics are available immediately; the
  owner can turn it off at any time in Settings. It remains separate from
  anonymous telemetry and never includes customer or order contents.

### Wording

Two placements. **Not** in first-run setup — a new user has no context for it, and burying it in a
wall of setup checkboxes is how you get consent that is technically obtained and practically
meaningless.

**A. Settings → Privacy** (below the anonymous-stats toggle), unticked:

> **☐ Let support see this store's error reports**
>
> When something fails — a printer, a sync, an update — send the error details tagged with this
> store, so support can look up what actually went wrong instead of guessing.
>
> **Sent:** the error code, which step failed, app version, operating system, when it happened,
> and this store's ID.
> **Never sent:** your sales, bills, menu, customers, or their phone numbers. No screenshots.
> Nothing your staff types.
>
> Kept for 180 days, then deleted automatically. Turn this off any time — new reports stop
> immediately.
>
> *Separate from anonymous usage stats above. Turning one on or off doesn't change the other.*

**B. Inline, when an error actually fires** — the better moment, because the user has a concrete
problem in front of them:

> Printing failed. *(support code: `KOT-4471`)*
> **☐ Let support see errors like this from this store** — [what gets sent](#)

Ticking it in either place sets the same flag. The inline link expands the same "sent / never
sent" text as A; it must not be a bare checkbox with no explanation.

**Rules the copy has to keep:**
- Unticked by default, and never pre-selected by any upgrade path.
- Never bundled with the anonymous-stats consent or the marketing checkbox — three separate
  decisions, three separate controls.
- Withdrawal is one click in the same place, and the copy says so.
- Plain language. No "telemetry", no "diagnostics payload", no "data processing".
- The "never sent" list is a promise the code must actually keep — if a field is added to the
  payload later, this text changes in the same commit.

## 5. Support hot button

The piece that closes the loop between a failure and a human.

- On a critical error, show the typed message plus a **Get help** button.
- Pressing it sends: store name/email/phone, app version, platform, failing stage, error code,
  correlation id, and a redacted diagnostic bundle. **The press is the consent** — no separate
  prompt, and nothing is sent if the button is never touched.
- **Show the exact payload first**, in an expandable panel. This is the difference between a
  feature people trust and one they turn off.
- **Durable local outbox with backoff.** Printer and network failures correlate, so the machine
  is often offline at press time. Queue it, retry across restarts, and show *"queued — will send
  when online."*
- **Offline escape hatch:** *Copy diagnostics* and *Save to file*, so a machine that never gets
  online can still be helped over email.
- Display the returned support code.

## 6. Consent fixes

- **Untick the first-run telemetry checkbox.** `seedInstallDefaults()` currently writes
  `telemetry_enabled = 'true'` and the setup checkbox initialises checked, so anonymous telemetry
  is on by default. A pre-ticked box is not valid consent under GDPR (CJEU *Planet49*) or India's
  DPDPA 2023, and FloCafe ships across ~34 countries. Change the default to unchecked.
  **Do not retroactively flip installs that already consented.**
- **Marketing consent is its own unticked checkbox** — "email me about updates and new features"
  — entirely separate from any diagnostics consent. Bundling the two invalidates both.

## Order of work

```
3 (taxonomy)  ─┬─→  4 (diagnostics opt-in)
               └─→  5 (hot button)

1 (auto-register)  and  2 (pairing)   — independent, can land any time
6 (consent fixes)                      — independent, small, do it early
```

§3 gates §4 and §5. §1 and §2 are independent of everything else and unblock the RevFlo path,
which is the priority for the cloud side. §6 is small and worth doing first regardless.

## Definition of done

- A fresh install registers, shows a pairing code, and a phone pairs to it with no manual step
  anywhere and no account to create.
- A maintainer can name the exact failing stage of a print failure without asking the merchant to
  reproduce it in a terminal.
- A consenting machine that loses the network still delivers its critical event afterwards, once,
  with no duplicates and no interruption to billing.
- Every new consent surface is unticked by default, and existing installs' choices are preserved.
